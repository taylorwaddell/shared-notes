### Levels of Reading
Preface: These are listed in a hierarchical order based of the demand it places on the reader. That being said, levels build on each other meaning that although level 1 is the easiest and least demanding level, it is a necessary part of every other proceeding level of reading. It might help to think of these levels in a pyramid structure where level 1 is the first layer, or the foundation, and the other levels build upon it.
- ##### Level 1: Elementary
	- This level represents basic comprehension. One can read without the need to look up every other word and can understand what the content is explicitly saying.
- ##### Level 2: Inspectional (p.32-35)
	- The above is true with the addition of being able to "intentionally skim" through a piece of writing and understand it's main points. This is a good way to determine whether or not a piece of writing will be worth pursuing the next one or two levels of reading.
	- Stages:
		1. Look at the title page and its preface. Read each quickly with the goal of understanding the subject of the book. Maybe even begin to think about the category in which this books falls into and maybe what other books also belong in this category.
		2. Study the table of contents. Think of it like looking at a road map before taking a road trip.
		3. Check the index of the book. Make a quick estimate of the range of topics covered and the type of books and authors referred to. When you come across terms, passages, books that seem crucial, give them a quick look up.
		4. Read the publisher's blurb. Sometimes these blurbs give a well articulate, accurate summary of the book. Other times, it is nothing but fluff, either way you'll be able to tell something about the book. Perhaps the book does not say anything of importanceâ€“and that is why the blurb does not say anything, either.
		- At this point, you may have enough info to make a decision as to whether or not to continue reading the book, put aside for later, or to not read it at all. If you decide to continue reading follow the next two steps.
		5. Properly skim the book. Focus in on the chapters that seem pivotal to the author's argument. If these chapters have summaries at the beginning, read them carefully.
		6. Finally, turn the pages, dropping in here and there, reading a sentence or two, maybe a passage or a couple pages. Never more than that. Try to gather a general idea of the main contention. Above all, read the last few pages, authors love to sum up their arguments and what makes there argument important or different in the last few pages/epilogue.
		- With difficult books, sometimes a part of inspectional reading is reading through the book "superficially" without the goal of understanding every little thing. The goal instead is to understand what you can and to grasp the general idea. Then, after, return to read it a second time with the goal of analytical reading. The superficial read is a brain prep for the deep dive. Also, understanding half of a really tough book is much better than not understanding it at all. (p.36-38)
		- Read quickly through the fluff, and slowly through the meat. Learn to recognize which is which. It helps to know what you are looking for before you begin so that you know when you've found it. (p.38)
- ##### Level 3: Analytical
	- The Essence of Active Reading (p.46-47)
		- Ask questions while you read. Then, while reading search for the answers.
		- At least the following four questions must be asked: 
			1. What is the book about as a whole? What is the main theme and how do the sub-themes and topics culminate to the main theme?
			2. What is being said in detail and how? What are the main assertions and arguments being made by the author?
			3. Is the book true, in whole or in part? This question cannot be answered before the first two questions have been answered. But once you understand the book, you are obligated, if reading seriously, to make up your own mind. Knowing that the author's is not enough.
			4. What of it? If the book has given you information, you must ask about its significance. Why does the author think it is important to know these things? Is it important to you to know them? And if the book has not on informed you, but also enlightened you, it is necessary to seek further enlightenment by asking what else follows, what is further implied or suggested.
- ##### Level 4: Synoptical
	- Serving as the mediator between multiple authors discussing/arguing their ideas on the same topic.

A goal of this book is to be able to learn from an absent teacher. (p.14)

### [[Note Taking]] Tools
Reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author. Presumably, he knows more about the subject than you do; if not, probably should not be bothering with his book. Marking a book is an expression of your differences or agreements with the author.

Here are intelligent and fruitful devices for marking a book:
1. UNDERLINING - of major points or forceful arguments
2. VERTICAL LINES AT THE MARGIN - great for emphasizing passages or parts that are too long to underline
3. STAR, ASTERISK, OR SYMBOL AT THE MARGIN - used sparingly to emphasize the ten or dozen MOST IMPORTANT STATEMENTS/ARGUMENTS in the book. You may fold the corner of each page on which you make such marks. This way you can quickly take the book of the shelf and refresh yourself on the main ideas.
4. NUMBERS IN THE MARGIN - to signify important sequential points/arguments
5. NUMBERS OF REFERENCE PAGES IN MARGIN - good for showing where the author may make the same point or contradicting point elsewhere in the book. Many readers use the symbol "Cf" to indicate the other page numbers; it means "compare" or "refer to."
6. CIRCLING OF KEY WORDS OR PHRASES - same function as underlining
7. WRITING IN THE MARGIN OR AT THE TOP OF A PAGE - good way to record questions and answers while reading. Reduce complicated discussion to a simple statement. To record a sequence of major points through the book. The endpapers at the back of the book can be used to craft a personal index of the author's points in order of their appearance.
8. USE THE FRONT PAGES - after finishing a book try to outline the book as an integrated structure, with basic outline and an order of parts. This will serve as a measure of your understanding of the work.
